      Mathematics is not about equations, numbers, computations or algorithms:
      it&#39;s about understanding. -

      Calculating machines do sums better than even the cleverest people… As
      arithmetic has grown easier, it has come to be less respected. -

      Electronic calculators can solve problems which the man who made them
      cannot solve but no government-subsidized commission of engineers and
      physicists could create a worm. -

      Imagine Aristotle revivified and visiting Manhattan. Nothing in our
      social, political, economic, artistic, sexual or religious life would
      mystify him, but he would be staggered by our technology. Its
      products—skyscrapers, cars, airplanes, television, pocket
      calculators—would have been impossible without calculus. -

      No Geologist worth anything is permanently bound to a desk or laboratory,
      but the charming notion that true science can only be based on unbiased
      observation of nature in the raw is mythology. Creative work, in geology
      and anywhere else, is interaction and synthesis: half-baked ideas from a
      bar room, rocks in the field, chains of thought from lonely walks, numbers
      squeezed from rocks in a laboratory, numbers from a calculator riveted to
      a desk, fancy equipment usually malfunctioning on expensive ships, cheap
      equipment in the human cranium, arguments before a road cut. -
